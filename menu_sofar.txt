-------------FRONT END SO FAR--------------------
consists of Game class and Display class.
Game 'has a ' display and uses it to display options that return integer values as those options.
After map generation
player chooses between new game,load game, exit
case 1 . chooses new game
Player is then prompted to create/upgrade/demolish or return to main menu
a function createbuildmenu is used and an integer is returned within it to make decisions

case 1.1 chooses create building
player is promted to select to create: utilities,commercial,residential,industrial
again a function to get the option is used , and returned as an int. a function buildingmenu is used to display the options you can build.

case 1.1.1 chooses utilities

player is then prompted to choose utility options. a utilitymenu from display is used within Game 
and game uses the integer returned to make a decision. getters and setters are used to display specific creation detail.

----OTHER CREATION CASES SIMILAR--------------------------------

case 1.2 chooses upgrade building.
player is then promped to select which type variant to upgrade.
a similar display and return function as creating is used. It follows the same logic of using getters and setters for 
specific upgrading information.
--------MAYBE FIND A WAY TO SHOW A LIST OF ALREADY MADE BUILDINGS AND SELECT WHICH TO UPGRADE-------------------
 

case 1.3 chooses demolish building
similar to upgrade, follows same logic for now. 
Maybe have a way to show already built/upgraded buildings and select which to demolish

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 TO-DO?
Make creation options for Government?
